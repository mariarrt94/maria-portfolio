Iâ€™m currently a **Junior Data Scientist at [DIME Analytics](https://www.worldbank.org/en/about/unit/unit-dec/impactevaluation/dime-analytics), World Bank**, where I coordinate efforts to strengthen **reproducibility**, build **open-source tools**. I support research teams in ensuring that evidence is transparent, reusable, and grounded in best practices.

Beyond coding, Iâ€™m passionate about **mentorship and capacity building**â€”I regularly train researchers and clients in **GitHub workflows**, **reproducibility standards**, and **data analysis tools** in both R and Stata.

My long-term goal is to help shape a more equitable and responsible data ecosystem, one that prioritizes **data ethics**, **diversity**, and **impact**.

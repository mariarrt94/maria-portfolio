# About Me

I am Mer, a **Mexican development economist** with over **7 years of experience** specializing in **data analysis, visualization, and economic modeling**. Proficient in **R programming** and various statistical tools, I have applied data science to address **gender, poverty, and inequality** challenges across Latin America and beyond.

My passion lies not just in the use of data, but in the **responsible and ethical use of data**—ensuring it is applied in ways that are **transparent, inclusive, and equitable**. I believe that how we collect, interpret, and act on data matters. I am committed to using data to drive **better policy decisions** and to create a more **just and equitable world**.
